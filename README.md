# LyftSample

This is a small sample application in flask. It has a route that handles a post request
and it looks for 2 arguments in a dictionary "x" and "y". It checks to see if these keys are present and checks to make sure that they are numbers. If they are there and numbers it returns a dictionary with a key names sum which is "x" + "y".
